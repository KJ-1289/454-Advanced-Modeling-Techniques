Assignment #5: Building a SPAM Filter as a Production Model (200 Points)
Data: The data for this assignment will be the Spambase data set from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase
Students will be provided with an .RData version of the data that has been pre-split into a 50/50
train/test split with column names that are compatible with algorithms used in this assignment. It is
important/required that all students use the provided data set.
Assignment Instructions:
In this assignment we will build a SPAM filter as a production model. Typically, production models need
to be models that are easily and reliably implemented into their production systems. For this
application we will look at three particular models: a basic WOE binning classification, a Na√Øve Bayes
model, and a logistic regression model. We will develop our models on the training data set and test
their out-of-sample performance on a test data set.
