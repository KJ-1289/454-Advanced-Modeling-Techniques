Assignment #1: Build an RData Data Set (50 Points)
Data: The data for this assignment will be the Spambase data set from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase
The csv data file and the data documentation will be provided with these instructions. Students are to
use the provided versions of the data to ensure that all students are using the same version of the data.
Assignment Instructions:
In model development we always need to clean and process data into a final modeling format before we
begin building models. Our raw data can come in many formats, e.g. a query straight from the database
into our modeling software or a delimited text file such as a tab delimited, pipe delimited, or comma
separated text file or ‘flat file’. After we clean and process our raw data it can be advantageous to store
the clean data in a generic format such as a delimited text file or in a format that is native to our
modeling software. In R our native data storage object is the .RData object.
In this assignment we will read in the csv file, process the file by adding the column names and creating
a 50/50 train/test split, and saving the final data set as an .RData object. The deliverable for this
assignment is a nicely written and well commented R script to be named
build_spam_data_LastName.R.
